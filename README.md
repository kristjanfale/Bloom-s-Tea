## Bloom's Tea

This website is a copy. You can see the original design <object data="website_logobly.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="700px" height="700px">

I recreated the site, to improve my CSS(Sass) skills.
Website is responsive. I tried to use as few media queries as possible. I used only one, for Hamburger Navigation.

- Grid, Flexbox
- Only one Media Query
- BEM
- Hamburger navigation for phones
